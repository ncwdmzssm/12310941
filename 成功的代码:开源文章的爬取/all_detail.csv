Understanding the Drivers and Outcomes of Ideologically Charged Social Media Firestorms: The Sociotechnical and Social Learning Perspectives,"['Tommy K. H. Chan', 'Zach W. Y. Lee', 'Meizhi Pan', 'Ke Sun']",Published online: 24 Aug 2025,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 42, 2025 -Issue 3",Pages 737-766,"Social media firestorms, characterized by the rapid spread of negative electronic word of mouth (eWOM), can ignite widespread criticism of a firm’s brand transgressions, service failures, product-harm crises, or ideological conflicts. This study, grounded in the sociotechnical and social learning perspectives, examines the drivers and outcomes of social learning in ideologically charged firestorms, which represent an emerging form. We investigate the effects of social consensus and message persuasiveness, platform content centricity, and individual–firm relationship closeness on the social learning of negative eWOM behavior and purchase behavior. Two studies, comprising longitudinal quantitative and qualitative surveys, were conducted. The results indicate that message persuasiveness is strongly associated with the social learning of negative eWOM behavior. Negative eWOM behavior subsequently influences post-firestorm purchasing behavior. The moderating effects of platform content centricity and individual–firm relationship closeness are discussed. These findings advance the literature and offer practitioners actionable insights into managing digital crises.","['Online firestorms', 'social media', 'electronic word of mouth', 'eWOM', 'negative eWOM', 'social consensus', 'message persuasiveness', 'social learning']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520170?src=
Can Correction Messages Reduce the Spread of Fake News on Social Media? The Impact of Information Updates on the Effectiveness of Corrections,"['Kelvin K. King', 'Diego Escobari']",Published online: 24 Aug 2025,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 42, 2025 -Issue 3",Pages 706-736,"Although government agencies and fact-checking organizations issue correction messages to mitigate misinformation dissemination on social media, their efforts have been largely ineffective. Drawing on Information Manipulation Theory (IMT) and information extracted from over 84 million tweets, we examine the impact of correction messages and explore how different information updates affect their effectiveness. Our empirical approach differentiates between subpopulations of correction messages. The results support the existence of two distinct types: correction messages that significantly mitigate the spread of fake news—a 1 percent increase in “effective” messages decreases the spread of fake news by 0.89 percent; and those that amplify the misinformation—a 1 percent increase in “ineffective” messages increases the spread of fake news by 1.37 percent. Despite the higher count of “effective” correction messages, they are less potent than their “ineffective” counterparts. Our study extends the tenets of IMT to correction messages to identify effective platform interventions and highlight the efficacy of information updates in reducing the spread of fake news. Furthermore, it offers significant insights to social media platforms and fact-checking organizations on designing and deploying effective corrections.","['Social media', 'fake news', 'news corrections', 'message updates', 'information manipulation', 'onine platforms']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520174?src=
Mixed Signals: The Effects of Online Rating Discrepancy on User Trust,"['Florian Schneider', 'Pavel Dykmann', 'Timm Teubner']",Published online: 24 Aug 2025,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 42, 2025 -Issue 3",Pages 894-925,"This study investigates how discrepancies in reputational signals across online platforms affect users’ trust and cognitive processes. Using an eye-tracking experiment, it examines participants’ responses to conflicting ratings, with a focus on attention patterns and decision-making. Results reveal that signal discrepancies significantly reduce trust. Participants exhibit increased cognitive load when confronted with inconsistent signals, as evidenced by longer fixation times and more frequent transitions between ratings. These findings suggest that conflicting information demands greater cognitive effort. The study also highlights the differential effects of primary (native) and secondary (imported) signals, demonstrating that platform-specific reputational systems play a dominant role in trust-building. By offering insights into the relationship among conflicting signals, trust, and cognitive processing, the study provides a novel theoretical perspective on reputation portability and derives practical implications for complementors and platform operators.","['Online platforms', 'online reputation', 'online signaling', 'online trust', 'online ratings', 'eye tracking', 'cognitive effort']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2520178?src=
Job Crafting in the Context of Enterprise System Implementations,"['Frank K. Y. Chan', 'James Y. L.

Drawing on self-construal and trait activation theories, we posit that personality traits associated with an independent self-construal (conscientiousness [CONSC] and openness [OPEN]) and an interdependent self-construal (agreeableness [AGREE] and extraversion [EXTRA]) promote and inhibit job crafting, respectively, with their effects moderated by ES-enabled opportunity (OPPT) and self-efficacy (SE). We further posit that job crafting increases job performance and job satisfaction. We tested our hypotheses with data from a public agency (n = 180) and a Fortune-1000 firm (n = 872). Results showed that personality traits, OPPT, and SE interacted to affect job crafting, which in turn increased job performance and job satisfaction.

It is unclear why consumers show this reaction, which we refer to as “algorithm discount.” To answer this question, we conducted a mixed-methods study in the context of digital news offerings, comprising 41 qualitative interviews and a choice-based conjoint analysis with 421 respondents. The results show that consumers’ beliefs about the love and effort imbued in the product, their curiosity about algorithmically generated products, and specific product characteristics, such as the type of news article, determine the algorithm discount. These findings extend our understanding of the emergence of consumers’ aversion to algorithm-created products and offer providers of such products insight into potential countermeasures.","['GenAI', 'generative AI', 'performative algorithms', 'algorithm-created products', 'digital products', 'digital news', 'algorithm discount', 'mixed-methods research']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487308?src=

For example, complementors lack standardized, reusable functionality that powers their applications and struggle to consistently generate desired outputs. To identify how complementors mitigate these challenges, we conducted an embedded case study of complementors in the OpenAI platform ecosystem. We identified four value co-creation mechanisms of embedded and stand-alone complements that mitigate the challenges: (1) utilizing system instructions, (2) providing context data, (3) curating user inputs, and (4) revising AI model outputs. Depending on the complement type, complementors employ these mechanisms, leverage synergies between mechanisms, and unlock previously not employable mechanisms. We contribute to research by revealing two novel logics—the reap logic and the differentiation logic—that explain how complementors co-create value by mitigating the challenges through the value co-creation mechanisms.","['Digital platforms', 'platform owner', 'complementarity', 'interfaces', 'APIs', 'open-endedness', 'strategies', 'value creation', 'apps', 'artificial intelligence', 'generative AI', 'GenAI', 'large language models', 'ChatGPT', 'case study']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487310?src=
Shifting Dynamics: How Generative AI as a Boundary Resource Reshapes Digital Platform Governance,"['Anne-Sophie Mayer', 'Angelos Kostis', 'Franz Strich', 'Jonny Holmström']",Published online: 05 May 2025,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 42, 2025 -Issue 2: Generative AI and Its Transformative Value for Digital Platforms",Pages 400-430,"Digital platforms are increasingly integrating Generative AI (GenAI) tools as a boundary resource to enhance the quantity and quality of content with the ultimate goal of improving platform viability. As GenAI tools hold unique characteristics compared to traditional boundary resources, platform owners need to adapt their governance mechanisms accordingly. To understand how platform governance evolves over time in response to this novel boundary resource, we draw on the distributed tuning framework and build on insights from an in-depth qualitative study of a digital content platform in the educational sector. We find that the platform owner deployed different logics of GenAI integration over time that were enacted through specific governance mechanisms. The shift in logics and respective governance mechanisms was triggered by a dialectic process of resistance and accommodation between platform actors. In this process, the GenAI-enabled boundary resource not only changed over time but also served as a means for the power dynamics between platform owner and complementors to be reshaped. Our study contributes to both the platform governance literature as well as recent debates around GenAI.","['Digital platforms', 'GenAI', 'platform governance', 'boundary resource', 'distributed tuning']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487312?src=
Heterogeneous Effects of Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) on Knowledge Seeking in Online Communities,"['Martin Quinn', 'Dominik Gutt']",Published online: 22 Jun 2025,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 42, 2025 -Issue 2: Generative AI and Its Transformative Value for Digital Platforms",Pages 370-399,"Generative AI (GenAI) may fundamentally reshape how users seek knowledge in online knowledge sharing communities. Although prior work found an overall decrease in knowledge seeking in online communities upon the availability of GenAI, the underlying dynamics across user groups have remained unexplored. This study addresses that gap. Drawing on commitment-based theory, we hypothesize that casual users—motivated by cost-benefit considerations—are more likely to reduce their question-posting activity than highly committed members. Using adifference-in-differencesanalysis, we find that ChatGPT’s arrival leads to a substantial drop in questions on StackExchange, primarily driven by casual users (about 18.2%). Motivated by information foraging theory, we reveal heterogeneous downstream effects of GenAI on question characteristics. In particular, we find that the questions by casual users become more complex and novel, while those by intensive and top users do not. These results highlight the importance of heterogeneous user motivations in shaping platform dynamics, underscoring that while GenAI may diminish overall participation, it may also increase the value of the remaining content. Our study offers insights for knowledge sharing communities, managers, and stakeholders reliant on user-generated data, providing a nuanced view of GenAI’s disruptive influence.","['Generative AI', 'GAI', 'GenAI', 'knowledge seeking', 'commitment-based theory', 'information foraging theory', 'knowledge-sharing communities']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2025.2487313?src=

Through intelligent automation, GenAI transforms boundary resources from passive interfaces into active, intelligent mediators of value creation. Democratization systematically lowers barriers to platform participation. Hyper-personalization enables dynamic, individual-level adaptation of platform content. Collaborative innovation transforms platform innovation by making GenAI an active participant in human-AI value co-creation.

Therefore, organizations might adopt chatbots to cut down the workforce for structured tasks and augment the remaining employees in unstructured tasks. Although there are substantial workforce implications for rebalancing work activities, few studies have assessed chatbots from the augmentation angle by focusing on employees’ performance, perhaps because of the lack of a theoretical foundation and research on this new phenomenon within organizations. Using a mixed-methods design, we developed a model illustrating the impact of chatbots on perceived work performance from the information technology artifact perspective. We then used the qualitative study to conceptualize contextualized technology affordances to enhance customer service, support decision-making, and improve business agility and chatbot support (i.e. informational and emotional support) in the context of chatbots.

We further explore whether the market context of the organization hosting the contest—social (non-profit) or monetary (for-profit)—moderates incentive preferences and their effectiveness. We find that individuals exhibit heterogeneous incentive preferences and often prefer non-cash incentives, even in for-profit contexts. Offering ideators a choice of incentives can enhance creative performance. Market context moderates the effect of incentives, such that ideators who receive non-cash incentives in for-profit contexts tend to exert less effort. We show that heterogeneity of ideators’ preferences (and the ability to satisfy diverse preferences with suitably diverse incentive options) is a critical boundary condition to realizing benefits from offering ideators a choice of incentives.

Architectural contingencies include internal application modularity, application inter-connectedness, and governance of surrounding application clusters. Evidence for the governance-architecture fit hypothesis is derived from analyzing temporally ordered data about applications (n= 225,n= 498,n= 193) from organizations in the media, banking, and utilities sectors over five years. Using a two-step approach with ordinal regression, along with Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models, our findings indicate that a fit between observed governance and the governance induced by architectural contingencies reduces the likelihood of application decommissioning.

We test our model using a social network of 4,011 IT professionals employed in a large IT firm over four years. We complement our analysis of this data with a multiple-case study with five software development teams. Across the two studies, our results suggest that the departure of an IT professional increases the probability of turnover among remaining coworkers; further, we found that turnover is even more likely when the remaining IT professionals are similar in technical abilities and demographic attributes to the co-worker who left. Our results direct attention to the immediate social context as an influence on the turnover behavior of IT professionals and explain how similarity in domain-specific attributes shapes this turnover behavior.

Studying how participants coordinate around the knowledge artifact and its impacts are critical for understanding the open knowledge production model. This study builds on the theory ofstigmergy, wherein actions performed by a participant leave traces on a knowledge artifact and stimulate succeeding actions. We find that stigmergy involves two intertwined processes:collective modificationandcollective excitation. We propose a new measure of stigmergy based on the spatial and temporal clustering of contributions. By analyzing thousands of Wikipedia articles, we find that the degree of stigmergy is positively associated with community members’ participation and the quality of the knowledge produced. This study contributes to the understanding of open collaboration by characterizing the spatial-temporal clustering of contributions and providing new insights into the relationship between stigmergy and knowledge production outcomes. These findings can help practitioners increase user engagement in knowledge production processes in order to create more sustainable open collaboration communities.","['Open collaboration', 'collaboration communities', 'stigmergy', 'work coordination', 'Wikipedia', 'community participation', 'information quality', 'Moran’s I', 'knowledge production']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2023.2229119?src=

Blood and Water: Information Technology Investment and Control in Family-owned Businesses,"['Abhishek Kathuria', 'Prasanna P. Karhade', 'Xue (Nancy) Ning', 'Benn R. Konsynski']",Published online: 30 Mar 2023,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 40, 2023 -Issue 1",Pages 208-238,"Family-owned businesses differ in their strategic intent and behavior as they serve as a reservoir of wealth and social status for their family owners. Family-owned businesses demonstrate relatively conservative strategic decision making that aspires long-term wealth preservation and enhancement. For family owners, investments in information technology (IT) raise a predicament as they are risky, yet a long-term imperative. We propose three hypotheses that build upon the thesis that family owners combine a deep understanding of the business with a strong influence on stakeholders within and beyond the firm’s boundaries to exert strategic control in the extended enterprise. First, family ownership negatively influences IT investment, because family owners are likely to avoid investments in IT that are frivolous, reduce information asymmetry, or leave auditable digital trails. Second, the negative influence of family ownership on IT investment is weakened when a career professional is appointed in the senior-most executive position of a family-owned business. This is because professional executives strive to utilize IT for control and performance benefits, and family owners desire to use IT to monitor and control the non-family professional executive. Third, family ownership weakens the negative influence of environmental hostility on the relationship between IT investment and firm performance, as family-owned businesses incur less dynamic adjustment costs and maintain better alignment between IT and business strategy. Empirical analysis, consisting of panel regression estimations, on archival data of publicly listed Indian firms in the years 2006 to 2018 provides support for our theory that highlights how IT for control acts as a noneconomic motivation for the strategic IT behavior of firms. In doing so, we bring family ownership into the theoretical foreground for future IS scholarship. We contribute to theory and practice by advancing the nature of ownership and executive management as sources of heterogeneity in IT investment and its business value.","['IT business value', 'digital transformation', 'IT strategy', 'IT investment', 'control', 'family ownership', 'professional executives', 'environmental hostility', 'emerging markets', 'family-owned business']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2023.2172770?src=

We chose the healthcare industry as the first target for this research because it has attributes common to many MO-MS domains, and because it faces significant challenges on a global scale, like the recent COVID-19 pandemic, for which MO-MS collaboration could offer solutions, as, for example, evidenced by the rapid collaborative development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. To this end, we reviewed 6,609 articles to find 100 articles that offered insights about the design of MO-MS collaboration systems, then conducted 50 semi-structured interviews in two countries with expert practitioners in the field. From those sources, we derived an eleven-category set of design concerns for MO-MS collaboration systems and argue their generalizability to other MO-MS domains.

These so-called low code platforms enable domain experts (e.g., business users without programming skills or experience) to develop SPAs for their purposes. However, using these platforms alone does not guarantee a useful and good conversation with novel SPAs due to non-intuitive design choices. Following a design science research approach, we propose the Smart Personal Assistant for Domain Experts (SPADE) method to address the missing link. This method supports domain experts in the development and contextualization of sophisticated SPAs for various application scenarios and focuses especially on conversational and anthropomorphic design steps. Our proof of concept and proof of value results show that SPADE is useful for supporting domain experts to create effective SPAs in different domains beyond private set-ups.","['Anthropomorphic design', 'conversational agents', 'conversational design', 'IS development', 'low code development platform', 'smart personal assistant', 'citizen development', 'end-user programming']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2023.2172776?src=

Two online experiments measured participants’ prosocial versus proself orientation and manipulated whether participants received a competitive or cooperative reward structure. Study 2 also manipulated whether participants viewed an original or a common peer idea. Proselfs produced more ideas when receiving competitive rewards; the idea generation of prosocials was not affected by the reward structure. This interaction effect was mediated by task effort and moderated the impact of peer ideas. Proselfs generated the most ideas when viewing an original peer idea and receiving competitive rewards; this effect was not observed for prosocials. The study contributes to crowdsourcing research by demonstrating that participants’ response to reward structures depends on their social value orientation.

In this research, we collect and analyze a large sample comprised of 5,392 IT projects to empirically examine the probability distribution of IT project cost overruns. Further, we propose and examine a mechanism that can explain such a distribution. Our results reveal that IT projects are far riskier in terms of cost than normally assumed by decision makers and scholars. Specifically, we found that IT project cost overruns follow a power-law distribution in which there are a large number of projects with relatively small overruns and a fat tail that includes a smaller number of projects with extreme overruns. A possible generative mechanism for the identified power-law distribution is found in interdependencies among technological components in IT systems. We propose and demonstrate, through computer simulation, that a problem in a single technological component can lead to chain reactions in which other interdependent components are affected, causing substantial overruns. What the power law tells us is that extreme IT project cost overruns will occur and that the prevalence of these will be grossly underestimated if managers assume that overruns follow a normal or near-normal distribution. This underscores the importance of realistically assessing and mitigating the cost risk of new IT projects up front.","['IT project cost overrun', 'IT project management', 'power-law distribution', 'fat-tails', 'self-organized criticality', 'component interdependence', 'technological component']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2022.2096544?src=

Our research investigates competing effects of emotions toward the rejection of AI monitoring for health care. Based on two scenario-based experiments, our study reveals that emotions play a decisive role in family members’ decision making on behalf of their parents. We find that anxiety about health care monitoring and anxiety about health outcomes reduce the rejection of AI monitoring, whereas surveillance anxiety and delegation anxiety increase rejection. We also find that for individual-level risks, perceived controllability moderates the relationship between surveillance anxiety and the rejection of AI monitoring. We contribute to the theory of Information System rejection by identifying the competing roles of emotions in AI monitoring decision making. We extend the literature on decision making for others by suggesting the influential role of anxiety.

In this paper we build on prior research that proposes the use of blockchain as an enabler for trusted, decentralized asset documentation. Applying a socio-technical lens, we describe how blockchain-enabled multi-party certification affords dealers the action potential to send signals that are more closely correlated to the unobservable quality of the underlying good (i.e., signals with a higherfit) than the signals they send today. We then both theorize and experimentally explore the market effects of the two types of signals. Using data from a laboratory market experiment with 210 participants, we find empirical evidence that multi-party certification affords dealers the action potential to send signals of significantly higher fit than those sent by intermediaries alone, leading to a reduction in information asymmetries, a more efficient allocation of goods, and an increase in market fairness.","['Blockchain', 'quality certification', 'information asymmetry', 'market for lemons', 'online signaling', 'multi-party certification', 'market mechanism']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2022.2063555?src=

We also examine the moderating impact of algorithmic control transparency on these relationships, as well as the outcomes of technostressors in terms of continuance intentions and workaround use. Based on a survey of 621 U.S.-based Uber drivers, we find that gatekeeping and guiding algorithmic control positively relate to both challenge and threat technostressors. The study bridges the literature on control and technostress by conceptualizing algorithmic control as a condition that puts workers under stress. This stress is found to contribute to important behavioral consequences pertaining to both continuance intentions and workaround use. Findings from our work suggest that gig economy organizations can use algorithmic control to enhance challenge technostressors for their workers, thereby contributing to the cultivation of a more committed workforce. Furthermore, we find evidence disputing the assumption that algorithmic control transparency can mitigate the negative effects of threat technostressors.","['Algorithmic control', 'Uber drivers', 'technostress', 'challenge technostressors', 'threat technostressors', 'algorithmic control transparency', 'gig economy']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2022.2063556?src=

We measure population-level depression using a well-established mechanism from the medical and public health literature, internet search of depression-related terms. We argue that the introduction of Pokémon Go, a mobile game that encourages outdoor physical activity, face-to-face socialization, and exposure to nature, may alleviate non-clinical forms of mild depression for users playing the game. To identify the effect, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to exploit the staggered release of Pokémon Go into 166 regions in 12 English-speaking countries. We empirically document a disproportionate decrease in depression-related search in those regions where users are able to play Pokémon Go. This finding lends credence to anecdotal claims that location-based mobile games may alleviate symptoms of depression of their users, underscoring the mental health opportunities of location-based mobile gaming and creating new opportunities for information systems research.","['Location-based mobile games', 'mental health', 'depression', 'search query data', 'natural experiment', 'difference-in-differences', 'mobile games', 'digital games']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2021.2023407?src=

Collecting data from China’s largest social media platform, we study the impact of a fake news flag on three fake news dissemination patterns using a propensity score matching method with a difference-in-differences approach. We find that implementing a policy of using fake news flag influences the dissemination of fake news in a more centralized manner via direct forwards and in a less dispersed manner via indirect forwards, and that fake news posts are forwarded more often by influential users. In addition, compared with truthful news, fake news is disseminated in a less centralized and more dispersed manner and survives for a shorter period after a forwarding restriction policy is implemented. This study provides causal empirical evidence of the effect of a fake news flag on fake news dissemination. We also expand the literature on platform interventions to combat fake news by investigating a less studied account-level intervention.

We argue that taking a brokerage position in competition networks has a positive influence on a firm’s performance. We then explain how the firm’s information management capability and its position in collaboration networks each have a direct positive influence on its brokerage position in the competition network.

We tested our model on data collect ed from 1,383 individuals facing potential cyberattacks of their emails in a field experiment. The results of polynomial regression with response surface analysis showed that attitudinal ambivalence is generated from the opposition between an individual’s evaluations of maladaptive rewards and social norms (i.e., descriptive norm and subjective norm). This attitudinal ambivalence, in turn, affects individuals’ evaluations of their coping appraisal process and protection motivation, and ultimately protection behavior. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications of identifying the determinants and outcomes of attitudinal ambivalence in the information security context. From a theoretical standpoint, our work contributes to the information security literature by incorporating attitudinal ambivalence, which arises from the intrapersonal and interpersonal appraisal processes, into PMT. From a practical standpoint, our work provides insights into designing effective fear appeals to avoid triggering attitudinal ambivalence and thus encouraging adoption of security protection behavior.","['attitudinal ambivalence theory', 'information security', 'protection motivation theory', 'two-factor authentication', 'maladaptive rewards', 'polynomial regression', 'response surface analysis', 'social norms', 'cybersecurity', 'security breaches']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2021.1962601?src=

Idea Generation in Enterprise Social Media: Open versus Closed Groups and Their Network Structures,"['Wietske van Osch', 'Burcu Bulgurcu']",Published online: 01 Dec 2020,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 37, 2020 -Issue 4",Pages 904-932,"Social network theory has produced conflicting results regarding the link between different social network structures—bridging versus bonding—and idea generation. To address this conundrum, we conduct a naturally occurring quasi-experiment of 126 open and 108 closed groups within an Enterprise Social Media (ESM) system of a multinational enterprise. Our findings show that idea generation occurs when the type of social network structure—bridging or bonding—is matched to a group’s openness or closedness, respectively. We further show that the reverse is counterproductive: when closed groups display bridging ties and open groups display bonding ties, idea generation is significantly undermined. Theoretically, these findings clarify the conditions and mechanisms by which both bridging and bonding can result in idea generation and provide a deeper understanding of the use of ESM for idea generation. Practically, our findings provide valuable and actionable insights regarding the use of ESM for idea generation in groups.","['Idea generation', 'enterprise social media', 'group openness', 'group closedness', 'social networks', 'network bonding', 'network bridging', 'group-level analysis']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2020.1831760?src=
Drivers of Supplier Participation in Ride-Hailing Platforms,"['Soo Jeong Hong', 'Johannes M. Bauer', 'Kwangjin Lee', 'Nelson F. Granados']",Published online: 18 Nov 2020,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 37, 2020 -Issue 3",Pages 602-630,"Ride-hailing platforms such as Uber offer service suppliers more flexible work conditions but lower security than permanent jobs. This study examines the preferences of ride-hailing drivers when they are offered contract and platform design options related to flexibility, financial security, and information features. The sample design and the discrete choice experiment approach we use permit the exploration of differences in the preferences of sub-groups of suppliers, including active and inactive drivers, drivers with and without other jobs, and those who multi-home. We find that the utility and willingness of drivers to work for ride-hailing platforms generally increase when the ride-hailing company provides a minimum wage guarantee, a company-sponsored benefit plan, and information features that protect drivers’ privacy and allow them to screen for undesired passengers. These attributes are important enough for drivers so that they are willing to sacrifice scheduling flexibility by committing to minimum working hours in exchange for those attributes. We identified significant heterogeneity in driver preferences. For drivers with a primary job or jobs other than ride-hailing, the perception of working conditions in the primary job affects their willingness to restart ride-hailing services. Preferences also vary depending on whether a driver participates in one or more platforms. These results suggest that offering a menu of contract options could provide novel tools for ride-hailing companies to improve the stability and predictability of supply. It may also alleviate some of the concerns about driver working conditions that have led to increasing calls for the regulation of ride-hailing services to protect drivers.","['Choice experiment', 'financial security', 'job flexibility', 'information transparency', 'Lyft', 'platform economy', 'ride-hailing', 'sharing economy', 'Uber']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2020.1790177?src=
How to Market Smart Products: Design and Pricing for Sharing Markets,['Thomas A. Weber'],Published online: 18 Nov 2020,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 37, 2020 -Issue 3",Pages 631-667,"This paper introduces joint product design and non-linear pricing in the context of sharing markets. Product ecosystems enable user sensing, setting the stage for the control of post-purchase consumption patterns. By varying the degree to which products can be reused and transferred among peers, a company can engineer their shareability, which together with a capacity of aftermarket control, allows for flexible non-linear pricing that involves charging for the initial purchase and for subsequent collaborative transfers separately. Using a dynamic model with heterogeneous consumers and asymmetric information, we analyze a firm’s economic strategy, including ecosystem design and flexible pricing, for long-term profitability. We show that an optimal product design balances durability-driven demand and price effects. Furthermore, for any given product design a profit-maximizing non-linear pricing schedule features retail price and sharing tariff in a robustly quadratic relationship, independent of the specifics of the consumer distribution. Various extensions, relating to the interaction of the firm’s policy with a sharing market and the possibility of time-varying sales distributions, are also considered.","['Aftermarket control', 'collaborative consumption', 'durability design', 'non-linear pricing', 'product ecosystems', 'sharing economy', 'smart products', 'product design', 'product pricing']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2020.1790179?src=
Design Principles for Signal Detection in Modern Job Application Systems: Identifying Fabricated Qualifications,"['Nathan W. Twyman', 'Steven J. Pentland', 'Lee Spitzley']",Published online: 18 Nov 2020,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 37, 2020 -Issue 3",Pages 849-874,"Hiring a new employee is traditionally thought to be an uncertain investment. This uncertainty is lessened by the presence of signals that indicate job fitness. Ideally, job applicants objectively signal their qualifications, and those signals are correctly assessed by the hiring team. In reality, signal manipulation is pervasive in the hiring process, mitigating the reliability of signals used to make hiring decisions. To combat these inefficiencies, we propose and evaluate SIGHT, a theoretical class of systems affording more robust signal evaluation during the job application process. A prototypical implementation of the SIGHT framework was evaluated using a mock-interview paradigm. Results provide initial evidence that SIGHT systems can elicit and capture qualification signals beyond what can be traditionally obtained from a typical application and that SIGHT systems can assess signals more effectively than unaided decision-making. SIGHT principles may extend to domains such as audit and security interviews.","['Signaling theory', 'job-application assessment', 'behavioral assessment', 'automated interviewing', 'virtual-agent-based interviewing', 'deception detection', 'human-risk assessment', 'NeuroIS', 'design science']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2020.1790201?src=
The Nature of Crowd Work and its Effects on Individuals’ Work Perception,"['David Durward', 'Ivo Blohm', 'Jan Marco Leimeister']",Published online: 01 Mar 2020,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 37, 2020 -Issue 1",Pages 66-95,"Crowd work reflects a new form of gainful employment on the Internet. We study how the nature of the tasks being performed and financial compensation jointly shape work perceptions of crowd workers in order to better understand the changing modes and patterns of digital work. Surveying individuals on 23 German crowd working platforms, this work is the first to add a multi-platform perspective on perceived working conditions in crowd work. We show that crowd workers need rather high levels of financial compensation before task characteristics become relevant for shaping favorable perceptions of working conditions. We explain these results by considering financial compensation as an informational cue indicating the appreciation of working effort that is internalized by well-paid crowd workers. Resulting boundary conditions for task design are discussed. These results help us understand when and under what conditions crowd work can be regarded as a fulfilling type of employment in highly developed countries.","['Crowd work', 'crowdsourcing', 'online compensation', 'online tasks', 'online employment', 'task design', 'self-determination theory', 'paid crowd work']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2019.1705506?src=
Cyberbullying on Social Networking Sites: The Crime Opportunity and Affordance Perspectives,"['Tommy K. H. Chan', 'Christy M. K. Cheung', 'Randy Y. M.

To address the research gaps identified in the literature, we draw on crime opportunity theory and the affordance perspective to propose a meta-framework that guides our investigation into SNS bullying. The meta-framework explains how SNS affordances give rise to the evaluation of favorable SNS environmental conditions for SNS bullying, which, in turn, promote SNS bullying. The research model was empirically tested using a longitudinal online survey of 223 SNS users. The results suggest that the evaluation of SNS environmental conditions predict SNS bullying, and SNS affordances influence the evaluation of these environmental conditions. This work offers a new theoretical perspective to study SNS bullying, highlighting the critical impacts of environmental conditions in shaping such behavior.

In this study, we investigate how different stakeholders in a large governmental agency connected to three on-going projects and their response to EAM initiatives. With a qualitative approach, we identify three options of response to EAM initiatives: (1) active compliance with the EAM strategy, (2) loyal but passive response, and (3) rebel solutions. We argue for the need of a more nuanced repertoire of actions for dealing with EAM and show how these responses are useful for understanding and managing successful EAM.","['Enterprise Architecture Management', 'IT architecture', 'organizational agility']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2018.1550549?src=

We develop a nomological network of people, process, and technology to gain insight into how the effect of technical project risk can be mitigated at the IT project team level. Drawing on cultural contingency theory, the IT project risk framework, and the IT project management literature, we elaborate on the IT project team composition and team processes necessary to mitigate technical project risk. We tested the nomological network by conducting a field study of 325 IT project teams over a 3-year period at a large corporation in China. We found that project risk mitigation processes mediated the effect of IT project teams’ cultural composition on IT project performance, and the effect of these processes on IT project performance was stronger under high levels of technical project risk compared to low levels of such risk. By incorporating the cultural contingency theory into developing a nomological network of technical risk mitigation processes, this work not only contributes to the IT project management literature, but also provides suggestions for practitioners on how to better leverage people, process, and technology in mitigating IT project risks.","['IT projects', 'technical risk', 'team processes', 'cultural contingency theory', 'risk mitigation', 'project management', 'project risk']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2018.1550555?src=

This work inductively and empirically derives a typology of cyberdeviance with 439 respondents across three phases. Our results suggest that cyberdeviance varies along 3 dimensions: cyberdeviant behaviors that are minor versus serious; cyberdeviant behaviors that target individuals versus organizations; and cyberdeviant behaviors that require low versus high technical skill. We thus provide a comprehensive framework that fosters a logical linkage of various research programs related to cyberdeviance to guide future research investigation. The typology will help managers to distinguish different cyberdeviant behaviors and implement suitable interventions depending on the behavior.","['and phrases: cyberdeviance', 'workplace deviance', 'typology', 'systematics', 'multidimensional scaling', 'IS security threats', 'IS use', 'cyberslacking', 'cyberloafing', 'cyberaggression', 'unauthorized IT use', 'computer abuse', 'inductive approach']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2018.1523531?src=

We used experimental methods for an in-depth exploration of two facilitation-based interventions in a convergence activity: attention guidance (focusing participants on procedures to execute a convergence task) and discussion encouragement (engaging participants in conversations to combine knowledge on ideas). Our findings show that both attention guidance and discussion encouragement are correlated with higher convergence quality. We argue that attention guidance’s contribution is in its support of coordination, information processing, and goal specification. Similar, we argue that discussion encouragement’s contribution is in its stimulation of idea clarification and idea combination. Contrary to past research, our findings further show that satisfaction was higher after convergence than after brainstorming.","['attention guidance', 'brainstorming', 'collaboration', 'collaborative brainstorming', 'discussion encouragement', 'idea convergence', 'idea quality', 'idea selection', 'ideation', 'satisfaction', 'team', 'teamwork']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2017.1393303?src=
Smart Products for Sharing,['Thomas A. Weber'],Published online: 17 Aug 2017,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 34, 2017 -Issue 2",Pages 341-368,"Sharing markets create mutual insurance for consumers who are unsure about their future needs for goods, thus rendering products more valuable both before and after the purchase. By embedding intelligence in their products, enabling them to sense, monitor, and authorize transfers between users, firms can economically participate in the collaborative consumption of their goods after they have been sold. Building on a dynamic model with overlapping generations of heterogeneous agents, we determine a firm’s jointly optimal product price and sharing tariff. The active use of product intelligence as a gatekeeper for collaborative consumption can narrow the gap between the retail and the equilibrium price in the sharing market. Because of its tendency to decrease the demand for ownership, the use of smart products with a positive sharing tariff does not always maximize the firm’s overall expected profits. A positive sharing tariff tends to be profitable with relatively high unit production cost and impatient consumers.","['aftermarket control', 'collaborative consumption', 'intelligent assets', 'Internet of things', 'product shareability', 'sharing economy', 'smart products']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2017.1334466?src=

We empirically assess the predictive ability of our framework using an ordinal multilevel regression model. Results indicate that deceivers minimize the use of referencing and self-deprecation but include more superfluous descriptions and flattery.

Product Pricing in a Peer-to-Peer Economy,['Thomas A. Weber'],Published online: 05 Oct 2016,Journal of Management Information Systems,"Volume 33, 2016 -Issue 2: Special Issue: Information Systems for Deception Detection",Pages 573-596,"The emergence of a collaborative economy has been driven by advances in information technology that allow consumers to borrow and rent goods among peers on a secondary sharing market. In a dynamic setting, consumers make intertemporal decisions about purchases and their participation in the sharing market. This study introduces an overlapping-generations model to analyze product pricing and consumer choice with and without a sharing market. The model quantifies the impacts of a peer-to-peer economy on the demand for ownership, the product price, and all participants’ payoffs, including consumer surplus, profits, and social welfare. Given consumers that are heterogeneous with respect to their consumption needs and valuations, it illustrates which of them are prone to participate in a sharing economy and whether a retailer (or manufacturer) can benefit from the presence of a secondary exchange. A sharing market tends to increase the price of new products by a “sharing premium,” which positively depends on the retailer’s commitment ability. The price increment becomes relatively smaller for higher-cost products. Low-cost products and sufficiently impatient consumers together make a peer-to-peer economyunattractive for retailers. For high-cost products, however, the latter stand to gain from the existence of a sharing market. Most important, the introduction of a peer-to-peer economy increases both consumer surplus and social welfare, thus creating an implicit imperative for a social planner to help promote collaborative consumption, for instance, by providing incentives for retailers and manufacturers that tend to offset possible expected negative payoff effects from consumer sharing.","['collaborative consumption', 'market equilibrium', 'monopoly pricing', 'overlapping generations', 'peer-to-peer economy', 'product pricing', 'sharing economy']",https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2016.1205933?src=
